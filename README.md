## My Projects
## Embedded Air Quality Measurement System
This project was part of class assignment with [Prof. Dominik Aufderheide](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=Q0FhgwIAAAAJ&hl=en). Project centers on designing an embedded system to monitor and report the Air Quality Index (AQI) using sensor data, including PM1.0, PM2.5, PM10.0, temperature, and humidity measurements. These sensors will play a pivotal role in assessing air quality conditions and their potential impact on health and the environment.[Project Link](https://github.com/Deeppathak/Embedded-Air-Quality-Measurement-System)

## Movie recommender system using Python(Pytorch)
This project aims to create personalized product recommendations using PyTorch to enhance customer satisfaction and boost revenue in e-commerce. The workload includes conducting literature research, pre-processing data, implementing the recommender algorithm, and performing simulation and testing.

## Real Life FEA project

My inspiration came from observing the wheel support of my home trolley, which frequently got stuck to the frame and failed to move properly. Driven by curiosity, I conducted static and fatigue analyses to identify the primary causes of failure using different materials. I initially chose strong materials like cast iron to see if there were inherent design issues. The analysis revealed that the design had flaws, as the bracket was bending even with these materials. I then improved the design and selected structural steel, which performed well in both fatigue and static analysis.
As a control, I also ran the analysis on magnesium alloy just to compare it to cast iron.

In this analysis scenario, I conducted a static analysis on a bracket using magnesium alloy under specific loading conditions. Here's the detailed breakdown:

### Case 1: Static Analysis for Magnesium Alloy

#### Loading Conditions:
1. **Force Applied:** 100 N on the top face of the bracket.
2. **Constraints:** The two holes at the bottom of the bracket are constrained.

#### Outputs:
1. **Von-Mises Stress:** Evaluated to determine the material's yield criteria under the applied load.
2. **Total Deformation:** Measured to assess the displacement of the bracket under the static load.

#### Results for Magnesium Alloy:
- **Total Deformation:** The component exhibited a deformation of 0.0076311 mm under the applied force of 100 N. This deformation is relatively high when compared to similar components made from cast iron.

#### Comparative Analysis:
- **Magnesium Alloy vs. Cast Iron:**
  - Magnesium alloy showed greater deformation (0.0076311 mm) under the same loading conditions compared to cast iron. This indicates that while magnesium alloys are lighter and often chosen for weight-sensitive applications, they may deform more under load compared to cast iron, which is known for its high rigidity and strength.

### Conclusion:
The static analysis results highlight the material behavior differences between magnesium alloy and cast iron under the same loading conditions. These findings are crucial for selecting appropriate materials in engineering designs, especially where mechanical performance under static loads is a critical consideration.
**There was also deformation in the cast iron, indicating a minor design flaw. This slight deformation may have caused the wheel shaft to get stuck due to the minimal clearance between the shaft and the wheel.**

### Case 4: Fatigue Analysis

#### Load Conditions:
1. **Static Structural Load Cases:**
   - **Load Case:** 100 N applied as specified in the static analysis with improved design with an additional support leg.
**Structural steel was chosen because the part can be manufactured using the forming process with sheet metal plates.**
#### Material:
- **Structural Steel** was used for the analysis.

#### Outputs:
1. **Fatigue Life:**
   The predicted fatigue life of the component is **1,000,000 cycles** under the given loading conditions.
   
2. **Damage:**
   - The component's **damage threshold** is identified at **1,000 Newtons (N)**.
   
3. **Safety Factor:**
   - The calculated **factor of safety** is **15**.

### Analysis Summary:
- **Material:** Structural Steel
- **Fatigue Life:** The component is expected to withstand 1,000,000 cycles before failure, indicating a robust design for the specified load conditions.
- **Damage Threshold:** With a threshold of 1,000 N, the component can endure up to 10 times the load applied in Load Case 1 before sustaining damage.
- **Safety Factor:** A safety factor of 15 suggests that the component's design is significantly over-engineered for the applied loads, ensuring a high level of reliability and safety.

This structured fatigue analysis highlights the component's durability and the effectiveness of its design under cyclical loading conditions using structural steel.

### Overall Conclusions:
- **Material Performance:** Structural steel proves to be a suitable material for the component, offering a balance of flexibility and strength. Its higher deformation compared to cast iron is offset by its excellent fatigue life and high safety factor.
- **Design Robustness:** The high safety factor and long fatigue life indicate that the design is robust and reliable, ensuring the component's performance over a wide range of operating conditions.
- **Application Suitability:** Given these analyses, the component is well-suited for applications requiring both high static strength and long-term durability under cyclic loading. It provides assurance of safety and longevity, which are critical in many engineering applications.

These conclusions demonstrate that the component, made from structural steel, meets the necessary performance criteria for both static and fatigue loading, making it a reliable and economical choice for its intended use because structural steel parts can be produced by forming operation.
**The analysis revealed that the primary issue was the weak support legs, which bent and caused the wheel to jam. This problem was resolved by reinforcing the support legs and redesigning the wheel**.
